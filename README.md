<br/>

So Typora is compatible with those silly font requirements.

## Usage

1. Download the CSS files for the theme(s) you want to install:


| Theme                        | CSS file           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Newsprint in Times           | `timesprint.css`   |
| GitHub in Arial              | `github-arial.css` |
| Whitey in Times              | `whitey-times.css` |

2. Open **Typora > Preferences > "Open Theme Folder"**

3. Move them to the themes folder

4. Restart Typora

   ***Note:*** I have found that it sometimes takes multiple restarts for themes to work. If this is the case, try restarting Typora until themes are working. 

---
Arial and Times New Roman fonts are not bundled because they are copyrighted. If Typora can't find the fonts, install them on your system.
